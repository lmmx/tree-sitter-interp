# tree-sitter-interp

An attempt to find the correspondence between:

- Node IDs and info available from tree sitter for the language (e.g. Python)
- Node types available from the language's tree-sitter repo (e.g. [for Python](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python/blob/master/src/node-types.json))
- Rules in the grammar from the language's tree-sitter repo (e.g. [for Python](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python/blob/master/src/grammar.json))
